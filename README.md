## ðŸš€ Features

- **Predictive Model**  
  - Trained a CatBoost regressor on student demographics and academic features.  
  - Achieved an RÂ² of 0.85 on the hold-out test set.
- **Interactive Web App**  
  - Flask app exposing a `/predict` API and a simple HTML UI for live predictions.
- **Experiment Tracking**  
  - MLflow tracks experiments, parameters, metrics, and model artifacts.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**  
  - Pipeline runs linting, unit tests, model training, and Docker image build on every push to `main`.
- **Containerization & Deployment**  
  - Docker image pushed to AWS ECR.  
  - Application deployed on AWS ECS Fargate.  
  - EC2 hosts auxiliary services (logging, monitoring).
